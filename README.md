# Fun-Matrix-Algorithm-In-Cpp


The algorithm requires the user to input a value , which will be the number of columns and rows of a matrix . In other words a square Matrix. The algorithm says the matrix's outter layer of numbers are always one , the layer inside of it are 0's , the next layer is 1's and so on . The matrix looks different with each column/row added and also it does look different if the number is an odd or an even number.
